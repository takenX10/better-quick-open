# better-quick-open

A simple vscode extension to replace `quick open` from vscode, to add routing and folders inside the results

## Features

- Open folders with `enter` or write the name with a trailing slash (e.g. `foldername/`) and it will automatically enter that folder
- If you search for a file inside a folder, it will search only inside that folder.
- `node_modules` folder is filtered

## TODOs

- Add language specific icons to files
- Implement a faster way to search for files and folders
- Implement a better way to update the folders tree when a new file gets created
